== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are videos opening full window (provider URL) when I click on them?
You are


= Can you add a video provider? =

I have no plans on implementing providers that include videos via JavaScript such as http://www.nicovideo.jp. I also will not implement videos from mainstream media news organizations. For others, feel free to ask.
