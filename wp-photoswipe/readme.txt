WP Photoswipe adds Photoswipe effects to your galleries in 5 seconds, using the Photoswipe Javascript component.

== Description ==

The current version includes mobile detection via the MDetect library written by Anthony Hand and different mobile/desktop settings on the default script.

The default settings of WP Photoswipe targets the `$(".gallery-icon a")` elements of your posts and pages and adds the Photoswipe component behavior.

If the HTML of your galleries is not the default, you need to add your own trigger script. You can copy and edit `wp-content/plugins/photoswipe/lib/psw.call.js`.

== Installation ==

Place the `wp-photoswipe` plugin directory inside `/wp-content/plugins/`, activate the plugin and enjoy.
